|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fly         | <kbd>G</kbd> | Same as Speed but also has vertical too                                                  |
| Speed       | <kbd>H</kbd> | Ignores velocity completely, will go exactly in the direction you're facing if holding W |
| No Fall     | <kbd>U</kbd> |                                                                                          |
| Step        | <kbd>J</kbd> | Instantly step up blocks                                                                 |
| X-Ray       | <kbd>O</kbd> | Doesn't work under Sodium                                                                |

| Free-Cam    | <kbd>K</kbd> | Not implemented yet, same as Fly but controls the camera instead                         |
| Anti-Effect | <kbd>L</kbd> | Disables blindness, darkness, and nausea                                                 |
| No Slow     | <kbd>N</kbd> | Prevents from slowing down on some blocks (WIP)                                          |
| Anti-Human  | <kbd>H</kbd> | Bypasses [the check on LiveOverflow's server](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WEMOCFe4EFE)   |

Fly, Speed, Free-Cam:
- <kbd>LEFT</kbd> to go slower
- <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> to go faster
- Jump or <kbd>UP</kbd> to ascend
- Sneak or <kbd>DOWN</kbd> to descend
